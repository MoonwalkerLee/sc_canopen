Hardware Platforms
==================

This module is most easily evaluated by running the CAN-CiA 301 conformance test on it. The details of this official conformance test can be found at the `CAN-CiA<http://www.can-cia.org/index.php?id=conformancelike>`_ website. For an application note on how to replicate the conformance test setup used internally at XMOS, apply to your XMOS sales representative.

Alternatively the module may be evaluated using any suitable CAN bus hardware and suitable CANopen master software. Since there are many possible combinations the details of coducting such an evaluation are beyond the scope of this documentation but any such evaluation will need at least the following sliceKIT items all of which are available from DigiKey:

   * XP-SKC-L16 (sliceKIT L16 Core Board) 
   * XA-SK-ISBUS sliceCARD
   * XA-SK-XTAG2 (sliceKIT xTAG-2 adapter) plus Power Supply
